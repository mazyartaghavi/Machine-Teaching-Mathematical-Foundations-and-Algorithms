# ü§ñ Machine Teaching: Mathematical Foundations and Algorithms for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Teaching

This project implements a novel framework for **Machine Teaching** where intelligent agents learn *how to teach other intelligent agents* to cooperate and coordinate using **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Teaching (MART)**.

It combines advanced mathematical tools across:
- Probability & Statistics
- Game Theory
- Control Theory
- Graph Theory
- Optimization
- Quantum-Inspired Algorithms

## üß† Core Concept

**Machine Teaching via MART** means teaching agents do not simply act optimally but instead learn to instruct other agents to *accelerate and improve* their own learning and coordination. The system supports centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) and can be extended to handle:
- Partial observability (POMDP)
- Quantum-inspired optimization (QAOA)
- Bayesian reasoning and Expectation-Maximization (EM)
